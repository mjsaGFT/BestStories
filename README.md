# BestStories

To run the application simply open a console and type "dotnet run".

Use Postman or any Browser to make a request.

Available endpoint: http://localhost:5261/BestStories/10

Where 10 is the number of stories you wish to get.

Ids can grow infinitely so paging of some sort is also something worth to consider.
